# Repository Structure
Function_Summarization.py: This script analyzes each Python function in the target repository and generates summaries, code snippets, and Abstract Syntax Trees (ASTs) for the functions. It orders the function summaries based on dependencies, ensuring that if Function A depends on Function B, Function B is summarized first.

Search_Mechanism.py: This script implements a search mechanism to navigate through the codebase. It allows you to locate specific data types (e.g., int, str, float, etc.) or search for specific function implementations and references within the code.
